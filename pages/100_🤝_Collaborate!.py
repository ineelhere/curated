**Curated** aims to assist individuals learning new technical skills
with a proper, well researched, community driven reference point to keep them
**well informed** about several awesome resources which they might find immensely useful in their journeys. In simple terms, the aim is not to teach. The aim is just to keep folks **informed**.

Now, creating such a project demands collective knowledge, skills and expertise. 
This is where you, as an open source contributor, can help!
