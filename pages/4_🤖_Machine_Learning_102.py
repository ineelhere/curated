### Let's dive deeper now!
Led by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), this course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. 

Topics include: 
- supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning 
- parametric/non-parametric learning 
- neural networks, support vector machines)
- unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods)
- learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice)
- reinforcement learning and adaptive control. 

The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.

### Deep Learning - CS230

Lectures from Stanford graduate course CS230 taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/).

You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.

You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.
